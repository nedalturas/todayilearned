## Why? 

Sï»¿ince I started my web development journey, I really dreamt of being able to create a personal webpage that I can write my thoughts into, a webpage where I can write my day-to-day learnings, though I am not sure about the commitment of writing everyday (I am a lazy ass person). So yeah, I really wanted to create a page that I can write my thoughts. I have personally chose to create this separately over a regular blog, if I'd write a blog it would be a different content, I might be talking about tech stacks or tools that I am using, so there's that.
